# The never complete, always changing JavaScript Style Guide by Vermilion for Vermilion (and for others)

This guide is for JavaScript only, and is intended to be a guide and not the bible. It is highly opinionated, and based on best practices. Because JavaScript is always changing/getting better (i.e. ES6), this guide will always be a draft. 

##### Here is a break down of what this guide contains.

* indentation and whitespace
* comments
* file naming
* variables
* arrays
* objects
* declaring functions, methods 
* working with classes and prototypes
* recursion

## Indentation and Whitespace
- **Identation:** 2 spaces
- **braces:** on same line for all blocks and functions
  -  **none of the below:**
 ```
function foo() 
{
  // do something
}

```
